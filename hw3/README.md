# HW 3 - Todo List App

Goal: Implement "Todo list" application using React where users can toggle task completion, add new tasks, and perform other related actions.

Basic Function:

1. Initially, the app will only display a blank area for the user to input their tasks.
2. Once the user enters a task and hits the enter key, a new task will appear on the list.
3. When the user clicks the checkbox next to a task, the checkbox will turn green, and the task text will have a line-through. Clicking the checkbox again will undo the task completion and revert it back to the "not completed" state.
4. As soon as the user adds a task, a footer will appear at the bottom of the app, showing the number of incomplete tasks remaining.
