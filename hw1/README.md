# HW 1 - Fake Google Meet

Goal:  Replicating the Google Meet page layout and styling using HTML and CSS.

Basic Function:
1. Each participant should have a different HTML element for the main screen, the circle in the center, and the information in the top-right and bottom-left corners.
2. When hovering over the main screen, three additional function buttons will appear in the center circle.
3. When hovering over the ellipse, the opacity of the ellipse will decrease (the color will become darker).

Advanced Function:
1. The information/functionalities at the bottom should be displayed from left to right, showing the time, meeting name, some function buttons, and some meeting information buttons, all of which are different HTML elements.
2. When hovering over the three additional function buttons in the center circle, a tooltip will appear above the button to display its functionality.
3. Clicking on the mute or camera button should toggle the mute/unmute or turn on/off the camera (the icon will turn red).
4. The web page should be responsive to different screen sizes, using responsive web design (RWD) to maintain the layout and full functionality.
Each participant's center circle should have three additional function buttons that can be pressed (displaying different opacity).
